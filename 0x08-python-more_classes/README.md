## Requirements :white_check_mark:

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
* Lazy PEP8? Try Cohort 2 - San Francisco’s Kim Wong’s trick
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
