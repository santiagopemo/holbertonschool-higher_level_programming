### Advance :muscle:
- [x] **[30. #pythonic](./)** - Write a function magic_string() that returns a string “Holberton” n times the number of the iteration
- [x] **[31. Low memory cost](./)** - Write a class LockedClass with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, except if the new instance attribute is called first_name.
- [x] **[32. int 1/3](./)** - Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration:
* How many int objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (103-line1.txt)
* How many int objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (103-line2.txt)
```
a = 1
b = 1
```
- [x] **[33. int 2/3](./)** - Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration:
* Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), how many int objects have been created and are still in memory? (105-line1.txt)
Why? (optional blog post :))
```
print("I")
print("Love")
print("Python")
```
- [x] **[34. int 3/3](./)** - Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration (For answers with numbers use integers, don’t spell out the word):
* How many string objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (106-line1.txt)
* How many string objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (106-line2.txt)
* After the execution of line 3, is the string object pointed by a deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line3.txt)
* After the execution of line 4, is the string object pointed by b deleted? Answer with Yes or No (106-line4.txt)
* How many string objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script (106-line5.txt)
```
a = "HBTN"
b = "HBTN"
del a
del b
c = "HBTN"
```
